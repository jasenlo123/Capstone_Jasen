"A victory for Malaysia’s judicial independence. Whatever the political fallout from the conviction and jailing of former prime minister Najib Razak, the country’s courts deserve a pat on the back.",SCMP Editorial
"Sensible policies are needed to win the war on coronavirus. As the ill-conceived and now-overturned ban on dine-in services shows, piecemeal responses by the government can backfire.",SCMP Editorial
"Mainland and overseas Chinese may be worlds apart over China. Such diverse groups necessarily have very different political priorities and sympathies, leading to misreading by self-centred Washington and Beijing.",Alex Lo
"Food for thought as rules to curb pandemic hurt Hong Kong workers. The decision to ban restaurants from offering dine-in services has left many with no place to eat lunch, except on the streets and even in public toilets.",SCMP Editorial
"University challenge: HKU must work to restore its reputation. The sacking of academic Benny Tai, one of the founders of the 2014 Occupy civil disobedience movement, has come at a time when society is already divided, with some now questioning the institution’s independence.",SCMP Editorial
"Why both sides get Benny Tai’s case wrong. His teaching of civil disobedience is perfectly justified but his firing is not about academic interference, rather it’s the fact that he has been criminally convicted.",Alex Lo
"There is no new cold war, the West is just losing influence in Eurasia. Is there a new axis between China, Russia and Iran against the West? Not quite. Beneath the surface of the anti-US alliance, there are undercurrents of hostility and scepticism. Across Eurasia, there is also a reluctance to take sides.",Raffaello Pantucci
"Masks are here to stay – we just need to keep them out of our landfills and seas. Every day, 10-15 tonnes of discarded masks end up in Hong Kong’s landfills, and more wash up on the beaches. The challenge is for Hong Kong is to design a mask that meets expert standards and is environmentally sustainable.",Bernard Chan
"Huawei’s troubles show why China’s tech titans will struggle to go global. If Beijing is serious about becoming a global tech power, then innovation is not enough; it needs real rule of law. Chinese companies will be treated fairly abroad only if China’s legal system evolves.",Andrei Lungu
"Hong Kong third wave: return to common sense and get people back to work. We have learned much about the virus, and we need to play the odds we have learned in order to stop crippling our economy and avert the worst recession in modern times. Risk can never be eliminated, but we must be willing to accept some pain as we try to restart our economy.",Richard Harris
End of ‘golden era’ in UK-China relations goes beyond any US meddling. The Johnson government’s sudden about-turn in favour of a confrontational approach towards China may not be entirely accounted for by the desire to break free of the EU or bowing to Washington’s influence.,Bob Savic
"Hong Kong courts duty-bound to follow the evidence in protest trials. Not everyone will agree with the ruling of judges when it comes to cases stemming from last year’s social unrest, but we must not lose sight of common law principles",SCMP Editorial
"Ad hoc response to pandemic shows gaps in Hong Kong’s governance. Officials have offered various forms of subsidies to ailing businesses, but the need for more targeted and decisive action is mounting by the day.",SCMP Editorial
"It’s the US stirring the pot in South China Sea. Manila and Beijing want to normalise relations, but Washington is standing in the way",Alex Lo
"Why the world needs a saner US approach to China. To the Trump administration, China is a threat, but it is also a critical nation for any global response to issues from climate change to pandemics. Effective US policy on China requires genuine alliances, and must not alienate the Chinese people",Michael Swaine
"Why Donald Trump’s order to end China Fulbright exchange is dangerous. The Fulbright exchange programme was born out of hopes for peace after second world war and reflected realism about the need to avoid another cataclysm. Stopping the flow of Fulbrighters between China and the US undermines decades of effort to build understanding and cooperation, and avoid uninformed miscalculations.","James V. Wertsch,Mark S. Wrighton"
"Coronavirus recovery: China’s Belt and Road is the ideal route for developing nations. There can be no global recovery, especially for developing countries, without a recovery in the cross-border flow of capital, goods and services. The Belt and Road Initiative can make a vital contribution, if it can be truly international, high quality and sustainable.",Mukhtar Hussain
"Why China is not gunning for a roaring economic recovery. China’s GDP rebound belies an uneven recovery and a widening gap between the real economy and capital markets. Instead of more stimulus, Beijing will want to rebalance the economy and carefully unwind policy easing.",Aidan Yao
"America’s polarisation over face masks a symptom of deeper culture war. The pandemic and the protests of recent months should serve as a reminder of a simple truth: a mask is just a mask. What matters for democracy is not whether people cover their faces in public, but which people do so and why.",Hugo Drochon
"By banning Huawei, Britain is turning its back on a 5G-dominated future. The UK could either choose to cooperate with Huawei and gain an edge in the era of the digital economy, or refuse and give up leadership in a 5G-dominated future. History does not wait for the hesitant.",Liu Xiaoming
"China must act now before the brain drain worsens. After dozens of people abruptly resigned from one of China’s premier nuclear research facilities, authorities must examine whether scientists are being given a fair deal.",SCMP Editorial
"We should all adhere to the new measures to combat coronavirus. The tougher rules, particularly those governing crews manning ships, could have come earlier, but it’s still not too late to turn the tide.",SCMP Editorial
"Poor Nixon must be rolling in his grave. Mutual engagement between China and the US remains the only sane option today, something that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is dangerously trying to undermine",Alex Lo
Donald Trump’s ending of Fulbright programme will only hurt Hong Kong and erode US cultural influence. The inexplicable decision is just the latest in a sequence of self-defeating moves that will weaken America’s global cultural and educational influence.,David Lampton
"Icy US-China relations and raging pandemic mean sliding dollar may have further to fall. While investors flocked to the greenback early in the pandemic, the George Floyd protests, consulate closures and the US’ Covid-19 response have all made markets reassess their positions.",Neal Kimberley
"How the China-Iran economic and security deal endangers India’s strategic interests in the Middle East. The deal, which throws Iran a vital lifeline and gives China access to Iran’s hydrocarbon reserves, imperils India’s strategic stake in the Chabahar port project.",Neeta Lal
"US-China relations: Pompeo speech shows few new ideas towards the ‘evil empire’. US secretary of state’s recycling of Reagan-era phrase shows some ideas are too good to retire, especially in the absence of new ones. Neither China nor the US appear to care what anyone thinks, leading to a perfect storm of distrust and communication failures.",Tom Plate
"Donald Trump can ensure a V-shaped economic recovery by heeding lessons of 1921. During the depression of 1921, the Harding government did not intervene in the market, resulting in a quicker recovery. The Trump administration must cleave to market principles, cease stimulus measures, rein in the Fed and resist protectionist impulses.",Walter E. Block
"Is Europe’s stimulus spending out of control? One way forward is to patch up trade relations with China. The amount of money earmarked for European recovery is huge, with scant regard for the consequences. Both the EU and China need more bilateral trade to stand any hope of a stronger recovery this year, but concessions and compromise will be needed.",David Brown
"Hong Kong third wave: the focus on protests shows flawed government priorities. The failure to address preserving people’s health and livelihoods in the security law reveals how blinkered leaders are. Unlike someone protesting for rights, someone with Covid-19 symptoms who goes on as if there is nothing wrong is harming public health.",Peter Kammerer
World should back China’s Mars mission. Mankind can only benefit from peaceful competition to extend and deepen our knowledge of the universe. It is no place for space wars.,SCMP Editorial
"Ant Group’s plan for listing shows the US is not the only option. Dual-listing in China is entirely doable and relatively painless, a far more attractive prospect than being exposed to hostile regulators and politicians in America.",SCMP Editorial
"Is China the West’s Frankenstein’s monster?. American politicians, now on a new anti-communist crusade, may not like the ending of the story",Alex Lo
"How Hong Kong courts resolve tension between national security law and Basic Law will determine the city’s future. The Hong Kong judiciary is being called upon to calibrate the ‘one country, two systems’ formula so that it comfortably accommodates Hong Kong cultural values with national aspirations.",Henry Litton
"Coronavirus crisis puts ‘immune systems’ of market and state capitalism to the test. While the US economy is predicted to contract 8 per cent this year, China’s GDP is expected to grow slightly. Governments around the world should take their cue from China and boost investment in infrastructure.",Anthony Rowley
"By painting its contest with China as a ‘good versus evil’ struggle, the US misses the mark. A recently released study revealing that Chinese citizens’ satisfaction with their government has increased since 2003 sits awkwardly against the US picture of China as a tyrannical state.",David Dodwell
Pandemic produces an environmental cost. Measures to battle the coronavirus have led to a surge in the dumping of single-use cutlery and food containers as well as used face masks.,SCMP Editorial
"Fishing ban the best place to start to bring life back to the Yangtze. With fish and bird species in the river’s downstream reaches in decline and food security threatened since the building of the Three Gorges Dam, authorities have rightly stepped in and curtailed human activity.",SCMP Editorial
"Massive EU deal the price of unity. Compromise over hundreds of billions of euros needed for recovery plan may be far from perfect, but it is critical to regional and even world stability.",SCMP Editorial
"For all our sakes, put on that mask and follow health advice. As daily Covid-19 infections in Hong Kong again hit triple digits, those who ignore rules to wear face coverings must be subject to tougher enforcement action.",SCMP Editorial
Hong Kong elections: the shameful absence of women from politics. Global evidence reveals women have shown political leadership by working across party lines even in the most combative environments. Every political actor contributes to the chronic underrepresentation of women in the halls of power in this city.,Alice Wu
"Legco election: what choices do moderate Hong Kong voters have in September?. Broadly speaking, only non-destructive opposition politicians and a revamped DAB will appeal to moderate voters. The elections should go ahead in September, despite Covid-19. If other communities can do it, why not Hong Kong?",Mike Rowse
"Why China must beware a less confident US, politically divided and pessimistic about its future. While American overconfidence after the Cold War led to the deadly war in Afghanistan, the US’ lack of assurance is fuelling its campaign to suppress China.",Zhou Bo
Why Beijing didn’t shut down US consulate in Hong Kong. Targeting US mission in the city would be a major escalation while China prefers to show restraint and not play into the hands of an increasingly hostile Washington,Alex Lo
"If a racist attack happens in a supermarket, what should the staff do?. Asian shoppers are reported to have been racially targeted at Australian supermarkets, even as racism complaints increase in the country after the onset of Covid-19. What responsibility do retail companies have for protecting customers from racism?",Suraj Girijashanker
"Why the struggle for same-sex marriage in China will continue, despite civil code setback. The primacy of heterosexual marriage in Chinese society means that there are negative social and economic consequences to remaining unwed. Coping strategies range from lesbian women and gay men marrying each other to couples tying the knot outside China or unofficially via an app.",Lucetta Kam
"How Hong Kong, divided by protests, can unite Yellowland and Blueland. True reconciliation is an urgent task, especially because many of the alienated in Hong Kong society are our own younger generation. Problems can be solved when we are willing to put aside our differences and embrace the values of pragmatism and common sense.",Rachel Cartland
"Anti-China rhetoric is not just US election bluster this time around. Experience has taught Chinese leaders not to take statements made about China during US elections too seriously. However, this time, the window of opportunity to reset relations after the elections will be narrower and the differences wider.",Robert Lawrence Kuhn
"Earnings season will tell if stock market optimism is justified. Most market watchers predict a drop and bounce-back in profits sharp enough to be called V-shaped. If they are right, the reporting of second-quarter company earnings now under way should reflect a turning point in global profits downturn.",Patrik Schowitz
"China-India relations: Ladakh stand-off need not be a prelude to war. If these nuclear states and rivals want to manage, stabilise and eventually transcend the security dilemma, they must incrementally build trust. Greater appreciation of the fears of one’s adversary paves the way for deeper dialogue and a trusting relationship, though this needs a delicate balancing act.",Ameya Pratap Singh
"Coronavirus has dealt class of 2020 a bad hand, but China’s class of ’77 offers an encouraging lesson. While graduating in a recession year can hit earnings and career prospects, life eventually rights itself, as the experience of the first batch of Chinese university students who graduated after the Cultural Revolution shows.",David Dodwell
"Hackers tweet serious warning to the world. Compromising the online accounts of the rich and famous is one thing, but trying to influence an election or even starting a war is quite another.",SCMP Editorial
"US and China should strengthen diplomatic links, not break them. Beijing has threatened to retaliate following the ordered closure of its consulate in Houston as the two nations raise tensions in a world that can ill-afford a new Cold War.",SCMP Editorial
"Who’s the brain behind Mike Pompeo’s anti-China stance?. His principal policy and planning adviser on China, Miles Maochun Yu, harbours some pretty dark thoughts about China and Asia-Pacific.",Alex Lo
"Covid-19 is making millions of domestic workers more vulnerable. Tech can help. As Covid-19 spurs policy shifts, governments have a rare opportunity to recalibrate policies and better understand the obstacles facing migrant domestic workers. Some apps are trying to prevent harmful working conditions in the first place.",Sophie Zinser
"Why Britain’s citizenship offer is a favour to Hong Kong – and China. Hongkongers have in the past sought foreign citizenship as an insurance policy. The UK’s offer to almost half of Hong Kong is unlikely to give rise to a wave of migration. Conversely, it makes people more willing to stay in Hong Kong.",Albert Cheng
"Closure of China’s Houston consulate shows danger of desperate US behaviour. Given the sharp decline in US-China diplomacy, the positive energy of the relationship’s early days has been replaced by petty bickering and recriminations. The brazen disrespect of science and international law by the Trump administration is akin to insisting American exceptionalism be respected at the risk of endangering public health.",Philip J. Cunningham
"EU’s Covid-19 recovery deal is a cause for celebration, but check the fine print. Market enthusiasm over the stimulus plan comes at a time economies in Europe seem to be reopening more successfully than the US. But the EU’s recovery fund, while a step towards fiscal integration, raises more questions than it answers.",Nicholas Spiro
"Britain, the new vassal state of the United States. Post-Brexit, the UK will have no support from the European Union as a middle power while China, once its best trading prospect, has become an adversary.",Alex Lo
"Our greatest enemies at this time are panic and complacency. As the crisis in Hong Kong hospitals grows with the rise of Covid-19 infections in the community, tests on urgent cases must come before people showing no symptoms.",SCMP Editorial
Hong Kong students pass their hardest test. Each one of those who sat the university entrance exams deserve to be congratulated after overcoming the challenges of social unrest and a health crisis.,SCMP Editorial
Coronavirus response: Working from home forces firms to evolve practices. Working from home has its challenges but could also bring an end to outdated attitudes at firms that still equate time in the office with productivity.,Richard Harris
"Donald Trump’s ending of the Fulbright programme in Hong Kong and China damages US soft power. The programme is one of the more successful examples of US cultural diplomacy. While Beijing’s threat to Hong Kong is serious, the US has maintained its Fulbright programmes with other countries it sees as adversaries.",Scott Laderman
"Carrie Lam’s policy pivot is too little, too late to heal Hong Kong. The chief executive’s acknowledgement that political impasse lies at the root of Hong Kong’s many problems is startling for stating the obvious. While some may welcome her U-turn, it’s hard to see how she can make peace with the opposition in the wake of the national security law.",Michael Chugani
"Will the European Union’s US$2 trillion trillion deal herald a new era of solidarity?. The package is distinguished not only by its size and the long drawn-out negotiations that led up to it, but also by its commitment to mutualised debt that paves the way for greater, future EU supranational powers.",Andrew Hammond
"Wounds from Yuen Long station attacks are yet to heal. One year on from assaults on innocent train passengers at height of Hong Kong unrest, questions remain about those responsible and why they have not been brought to justice.",SCMP Editorial
"The need remains for foreign judges with national security law  . As the Beijing-imposed legislation continues to raise concern among local and overseas legal communities, it is essential Hong Kong’s judiciary keeps its top international talent.",SCMP Editorial
"TikTok is the new Chinese threat to US national security. The way some American politicians describe the harmless social app, you would think it’s more dangerous than Huawei, the 5G networks supplier, and nuclear weapons",Alex Lo
"Why the risk of a US-China hot war is small despite heated talk. Bilateral ties are closer than the US and Soviet relations were during the Cold War, the ideological confrontation less intense, and decoupling, while painful, buys a modicum of peace and security.",Cui Lei
"Why US travel ban on China’s Communist Party members is a misguided idea. It would be a mistake for the United States to think it can separate the Chinese government from the Chinese people, or the party and the Chinese people. If the US truly wants the Chinese people to succeed, it should stop undermining the Chinese government as only it can help them be successful.",Zhengxu Wang
"Polls need to signal new chapter for Hong Kong’s Legislative Council. As another unedifying term comes to a close for the Hong Kong legislature, concerted efforts are required from all for the sake of governance and political development.",SCMP Editorial
"No measure too small in struggle to turn back tide of infection. As the number of Covid-19 cases grows and Hong Kong leader warns of further peril in the winter, now is the time for a comprehensive, proactive anti-pandemic strategy.",SCMP Editorial
"Living with coronavirus: We can forget about a quick return to normal. We might need to live with mask wearing and social distancing for several years. For Hong Kong, the authorities could greatly expand outdoor dining, stagger office hours, have more work-from-home periods and fewer air-conditioned interiors.",Martin Williams
Why it’s misleading to call US-China rivalry the new cold war. Most Chinese today don’t suffer from the same repression and material deprivation of those who lived in the Soviet Union; some may even think they will win in their country’s confrontation with the West,Alex Lo
"US-China rivalry: How companies can adjust to geopolitical shift as decoupling accelerates. Companies can count on the rules and dispute resolution mechanisms of free-trade agreements, take advantage of western funding agencies such as the DFC and seek global forums such as Apec to keep conversations going.","James Carouso,Penny Tucker"
"What if Donald Trump is a one-term president? Why three trade issues can wait. America’s trade partners are closely watching the November presidential election. Whether it is the WTO, China or carmakers, decision makers could be preparing for the possibility that the Trump administration will be voted out.",Stephen Olson
"Hong Kong elections: opposition must be realistic and not just oppose Beijing. Hong Kong democrats still think in terms of opposition and resistance after 23 years in the minority, something the government has fostered by not sharing power. If they do win a majority, they should provide policy alternatives that would improve the social and economic welfare of the people, not just pick fights.",Frank Ching
Trump’s Hong Kong Autonomy Act will only push city closer to mainland China. Washington’s moves in response to the passage of the national security law will weaken Hong Kong’s economic ties to the US and create a gap China will fill.,Neal Kimberley
"For US-China relations to improve, diplomats have to step back from Twitter. The finessed language of diplomacy has given way to hashtags and zingers between US State Department hawks and China’s ‘wolf warriors’. But diplomacy rarely succeeds when executed over a microphone.",Chi Wang
"India could lead a middle-power response to China in the Asia-Pacific. The recent border stand-off has prompted India to rethink its policy on China. As the US proves to be an unpredictable ally, India must speak up for other Asia-Pacific nations while eschewing the trade protectionism that has curtailed its influence.",Mohamed Zeeshan
"Donald Trump is picking the wrong fights in his re-election campaign. As the economic devastation caused by the pandemic deepens, Americans are more concerned for their survival than the stock market gains Trump touts. They are also in no mood for the economic costs of a US-China decoupling.",Robert Delaney
"Coronavirus recovery: Unemployment crisis calls for new policy focus. In a world of rising unemployment, governments must focus on job creation initiatives and look out for workers’ rights when firms attempt to put profits above people.",David Brown
"Why the coronavirus pandemic will turbocharge investment in data centres. The turn to digital infrastructure during the Covid-19 pandemic has boosted the existing boom in investor interest in data centres. Given that data centres are capital-intensive and require significant technical expertise, investors could consider investing directly in the operating company itself",Nicholas Spiro
"Judiciary must do all that it can to educate. After thousands of complaints were filed against at least three magistrates over their handling of cases related to anti-government protests, the move to publish some on online along with the judiciary’s response is welcomed.",SCMP Editorial
Boris Johnson may still be trying to be flexible over Huawei ban. Britain’s policy U-turn to ban gear supplied by the Chinese telecoms giant from its 5G networks meets the demands of an insistent Washington.,SCMP Editorial
"Beijing enjoys greater legitimacy than any Western state. You are free to hate and despise China all you want, but if you think it will collapse by its own weight because its government lacks legitimacy or popular support, you will always be surprised and never understand your enemy",Alex Lo
"The maths behind Britain’s Huawei U-turn and pivot to the Indo-Pacific. There is an upside for Britain in working more closely with its traditional allies – the US, Australia and Japan – in the region. Free-trade agreements with all three countries all hang in the balance.",Sam Olsen
"Under Trump, US narrative of the China threat is simply false. China’s pattern of behaviour and priorities have been largely consistent since 1978, even if the pace of its opening up is not to the West’s liking. While Beijing has become more assertive internationally, the true system-breaker has been Washington.",David Dodwell
A home-cooked meal has many advantages. ,SCMP Editorial
"Dialogue is urgently needed to avoid the crossing of red lines. With an increasing risk of military conflict in the South China Sea between China and the United States, there is every need for a diplomatic solution, no matter how remote that may appear",SCMP Editorial
"More confrontation looms on Hong Kong horizon. The pro-democrats’ primary saw the defeat of prominent veterans by more radical youngsters, leaving the way open for the Beijing and city governments to act tougher.",SCMP Editorial
"Relationships should be repaired in name of economic recovery. China’s unexpected growth figures are positive for the world and, although there are many thorny issues to resolve with the West, stress why there is need to find common ground.",SCMP Editorial
"Fear of Hong Kong security law spreads in Vancouver, but some dare wave the black flags of ‘revolution’. Canadian protesters worry they will be arrested if they return to Hong Kong. Some go to great lengths to conceal their identities from authorities and keep their activities secret from family members.",Ian Young
Dark times ahead for Hong Kong legislature. People in the city now face the choice of a paralysed legislature or a discredited one.,Alex Lo
"ESG investing: How markets are going the wrong way to save the planet. Worthy as its basic aims are, ESG fails to offer direct routes for private investors to fund critical projects at scale. The participation of governments and multilateral development agencies, for example, is needed, to provide a pipeline of projects and markets to help finance them.",Anthony Rowley
"China’s bold makeover of its capital markets a step in the right direction. Proposals include allowing banks to underwrite securities, consolidating the fragmented brokerage sector, and letting insurers trade in T-bond futures – a sign that Beijing is turbocharging its financial reforms.",Joel A. Gallo
US’ tougher stance on the South China Sea is part of Trump’s re-election campaign. Trump’s team is using China as one of its lines of attack against the president’s opponent Joe Biden while capitalising on the growing realisation in the Asia-Pacific region that China’s expansionist plans must be countered.,Brian P. Klein
"Hong Kong’s class of 2020, bracing for DSE results, is well placed to brave pandemic-ravaged world. This year’s school leavers started the academic year during the height of the protests and ended it amid the Covid-19 outbreak. The times have bequeathed them the ingredients to foster fortitude and compassion and to see the world with clarity.",Alice Wu
"Uncertainty over national security law is pushing Hong Kong people to leave. Most Hongkongers can agree on a need for a national security law. But the law should also consider Hongkongers’ concerns and fears, or it could cause an exodus of talent.",Peter G. de Krassel
"Are coronavirus lockdowns justified given the health, economic and social costs?. While billions are being pumped into Covid-19 vaccine research, diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria continue to have high mortality rates. Perhaps, Covid-19 is attracting attention because it largely affects old people in rich countries.",Philip Bowring
"It’s too early to count Hong Kong out just yet. Despite US actions against the city, it is arguable that it will remain a financial hub with its own legal system and will continue to play an important global role.",SCMP Editorial
"Now China must rise to floods challenge after Covid-19 fight . Economically and politically, the country – especially the initial coronavirus epicentre of Wuhan and Hubei province – can ill afford another heavy blow.",SCMP Editorial
Why China’s A-share market is starting to look like a safe haven. China’s economic recovery is on track and policies are cautiously supportive. US tensions and tariff risks remain but China’s containment of resurgent infections lends its stock market characteristics of a relative safe haven.,Sylvia Sheng
"US plays dangerous game with no end goal. What is perhaps most damaging is that America wants to drag its allies and friends into its fight with China, without defining or understanding what it is they want",Alex Lo
"Why America’s pandemic carnage is a tragedy of global proportions. An America reeling from the emotional trauma of a mismanaged pandemic is incapable of rational policy. When the world’s leading economy and military power feels vulnerable and insecure, there can be no global peace.",Andrew Sheng
"Amid the rush to condemn the national security law, let’s count the freedoms Hong Kong still has. The evidence that Hong Kong’s freedoms have been suppressed is poor. An honest position should be to acknowledge that a security law is needed, and emphasise that Hong Kong’s future depends on Beijing’s respect for its high degree of autonomy.",David Dodwell
"Coronavirus third wave: Group testing can address Hong Kong’s limited capacity. Hong Kong currently has a quarter to a fifth of the capacity it needs to handle Covid-19, and testing the entire population is prohibitively expensive. Emulating the group testing approach taken in Germany, Israel and the mainland can help make more efficient use of the city’s resources.",Daniel Z. Long
"National security law: Hong Kong’s librarians must stand firm to protect intellectual freedom. As the authorities increasingly give in to the urge to censor books, librarians should remain guided by their commitment to uphold the freedom of enquiry. Films and artworks that depict ways to evade the censors offer inspiration.",Daniel C. Tsang
"Coronavirus recovery: hedging and market volatility show flaws in bullish narrative. While equity markets hail a rebound in economic activity and tech sector resilience, bond markets fear a severe Covid-19 shock driven by a spike in infections. If markets were really confident about the strength of the rise in economic activity, investors would not be hedging so aggressively against further turmoil.",Nicholas Spiro
"Shame on Trump for using international students as political pawns. The Trump administration’s aborted visa rule change, which threatened deportation for foreign students in the US, was political and desperate. Kudos to the US universities and companies who stood up and fought to right a wrong",Bernard Chan
"Coronavirus action now will save greater pain later. As the number of local Covid-19 infections in Hong Kong rises again, the government and public must work together to bring the situation under control.",SCMP Editorial
"Both US and China stand to lose if Hong Kong is badly damaged. Punitive American measures in response to Beijing’s national security law will not spell the end of the city, but both sides have to think carefully before their next move.",SCMP Editorial
"How to weaponise Hong Kong against China. The opposition have got more than they bargained for, now that US President Donald Trump has stripped the city of its special trade status to treat it the same as the mainland.",Alex Lo
"Hong Kong national security law: New institutions show China’s true intent. The new law devotes a great deal of attention to setting up special institutions and procedures for handling cases deemed to involve national security. Assurances over constraints on these institutions are weakened by the central government’s treatment of Gui Minhai, Pu Zhiqiang and others politically disfavoured by Beijing.",Donald Clarke
"How the US Federal Reserve created a financial opioid crisis in the West. By targeting asset prices to bolster the economy, the Federal Reserve is again creating an asset bubble. The US central bank’s loose monetary policy, more than China, is really to blame for the US’ troubles now.",Andy Xie
"The US is finally taking sides in the South China Sea – against Beijing’s claims. By aligning the US more closely with the tribunal’s finding in 2016, Pompeo effectively states the nine-dash line has ‘no basis in international law’. While he was careful not to say whether Washington favoured one claimant over another, the US finally appears to be taking a side – against China.",Christian Le Miere
"Carrie Lam warns against constitutional coup. The good news for the opposition is that the government may be preparing for their majority in the new legislature for the first time in Hong Kong history; the bad news is that if they try to exploit Article 52 of the Basic Law to get rid of her, she will retaliate with the national security law.",Alex Lo
Hong Kong care homes for elderly have to follow the rules. The cluster of Covid-19 infections at a Kowloon facility housing some of society’s most vulnerable members underlines why safety guidelines must be mandatory.,SCMP Editorial
"Pan-democrats face uphill fight despite Hong Kong primary turnout. Stakes may have been raised with more than 610,000 people making their choice ahead of September’s elections, but considerable challenges lie ahead for the opposition camp as it seeks a Legislative Council majority.",SCMP Editorial
"If the US wants to be a human rights beacon, it has to hold itself to a higher standard. Criticism of the US human rights record has grown and, while it is nowhere as dismal as in countries like China or North Korea, if America is to represent a higher standard, it should behave as though it does and reform where it does not.",Rob York
"Trump’s student visa rules have been rescinded, but the damage is done. Cultural exchange has long been a core element of US diplomacy, and the business of educating the world is big business. The ill-conceived policy ploy to deport students, though reversed, still puts a serious dent in the US’ reputation as a desirable place to study.",Philip J. Cunningham
"Why Asia’s rapidly growing bond markets are still vulnerable to financial stress. Asian bond markets have grown massively since the 1997 currency crisis but remain dominated by government bonds and, while attracting huge foreign investor interest, also create capital flight vulnerabilities","Ramkishen S. Rajan,Sasidaran Gopalan"
"Zero interest rates, heavy debt will be new normal in coronavirus recovery. The lessons learned from the 2008 global financial crisis suggest shutting off the liquidity tap could prove more challenging than opening it. Ultra-accommodative monetary policy is here to stay, with central banks also engaging in riskier asset purchases and even negative interest rates.",Aidan Yao
"Hong Kong coronavirus third wave can be tamed by mass testing – with China’s help. The local government has resorted to its old, small policy toolkit of social distancing, travel bans and dissuasion. Given the constraints on Hong Kong’s ability to test its population, it is perhaps a good idea to seek help from the mainland, which has excess capacity.",Alex He Jingwei
"Under national security law, Hong Kong can be pro-democracy without being anti-China. Speculation about the impact of the law must give way to a democratic agenda crafted for these post-security law times. Democratic development will benefit not just Hong Kong, but also help it fulfil its role as China’s international city.",Kerry Kennedy
Latest rules have to be respected if virus infections are to fall in Hong Kong. The tightening of social-distancing measures by the government is to be welcomed as Hong Kong reaches tipping point and Covid-19 cases mount.,SCMP Editorial
"Singapore election a vote for stability. The city state’s ruling party has weathered a crisis poll, now it must work with the opposition to confront challenges, contribute to region’s growth and ensure balanced ties with China and the US",SCMP Editorial
"Opposition ‘primary’ signals internal conflict. Despite large turnouts, ‘loser’ candidates, especially those with a long track record as lawmakers, are unlikely to accept the results in favour of radicals who face disqualification anyway",Alex Lo
"National security law’s grey lines blur Hong Kong’s future as a global financial centre. If Hong Kong is to be more than China’s offshore financial market, it must retain its free press, independent judiciary and honest civil service.",Mark Clifford
Attacking Hong Kong dollar peg would hurt those the US hopes to help. Washington should bin such proposals as the people of Hong Kong stand to lose the most from undermining the Linked Rate Exchange System. Pursuing them in an attempt to punish China risks immediate damage to US international standing as well as introducing more risks into the global economy.,Neal Kimberley
"With new student visa rule, Donald Trump is making America small again. International students at US universities are a core arsenal of American soft power. By closing its doors, the Trump administration undermines America’s stature as a responsible stakeholder in global affairs.",Tom Plate
"On Covid-19, India’s Narendra Modi is no Donald Trump or Jair Bolsonaro, but the country’s coronavirus outlook is grim. India’s prime minister imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in the world on his country, but a few weeks or even months was never going to make up for health-sector upgrades that should have taken place years earlier.",Rukmini S
"Hong Kong third wave: Public needs to step up and keep coronavirus at bay. One major reason the Hong Kong approach to managing Covid-19 has succeeded so far is the public’s responsible behaviour during the pandemic.

"What Hong Kong’s national security law makes clear: politics trumps business.

Nevertheless, any business accustomed to navigating the mainland should be able to adjust to the new reality.",Joshua M. Zimmerman
"Truth of Hong Kong’s national security law will prevail over fog of Western criticism.

Why Beijing must respect Hong Kong courts’ interpretation of national security law.

"Bumbling, wasteful US should learn from China’s coronavirus response.

"National security law: more questions than answers on Hong Kong’s freedoms and rule of law.

The government must start to remedy any racial injustices in the community.",Justin Bong-Kwan
"WTO has a key role to play in global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Despite its recent struggles, the WTO still has an irreplaceable role in transforming countries’ economic prospects and people’s lives. Failure to revive an effective, rules-based international trade system will undermine efforts to tackle a global recession.",Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala
"Why dreams of easy coronavirus recovery crumble in face of reality. The first wave of the pandemic is not yet over but politicians worldwide are declaring victory and rushing to reopen their economies. Lingering uncertainty, spreading recession and a lack of political will threaten to make even the current pessimistic predictions look rosy in hindsight",Brian P. Klein
"70 years since the Korean war, the threat of armed conflict still hangs over the peninsula. North Korea’s destruction of the inter-Korea liaison office in Kaesong dashed hopes that international diplomacy over the past few years was finally healing divisions. A dual-track approach is needed to defuse Pyongyang’s nuclear threat.",John Barry Kotch

Galwan border clash a nightmare come true for India and China. China’s actions are counterproductive in the long run as they push India into the camp of those powers with shared apprehensions about China. This should drive home the urgency to amicably settle the border dispute and not leave it for future generations to resolve.,Anit Mukherjee
"Why Hong Kong’s property market will benefit from falling office rent in pricey Central. While the economic downturn that has led to a decline in both rent and leasing activity in the world’s most expensive office market is worrying, a narrower rental gap between Central and other districts would set up the market for a healthier, more stable recovery.",Nicholas Spiro
"Can we believe China will reform its economy this time, given the empty promises of the past?. The government cannot pursue stimulus like it did in 2008 as piling on more debt would aggravate the risks to the economy. Significant economic reforms are needed to level the global playing field and prevent many foreign players from packing up and leaving China.","Kevin Rudd,Daniel Rosen"
"Donald Trump may lack a coherent China policy, but he got something right. The US president understood that his predecessors gave away far more to China than the US received. Post-Trump, Washington and its allies will need to play a long game, demanding from China changes that should have been made a long time ago.",Robert Delaney
"Why China cannot pin its hopes on global demand to boost economic recovery. The US-China trade war, Donald Trump’s ‘America first’ policies and the marginalisation of global institutions have hurt the world’s ability to deal with the economic and health crisis.

"National security law: as ‘us versus them’ divisions are amplified, hope fades for Hong Kong. Hongkongers’ issue with the national security law has always been the lack of public consultation.

"Is the door closing for Beijing’s ‘wolf warriors’ on Twitter amid a US-China disinformation war?.

"Rather than decouple, China and the US must find ways to coexist. Clear thinkers in China know no one wins with a bitter divorce from the US.

"US presidential election: between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, China is likely to prefer the devil it knows.

"How to prevent Hong Kong police and the press from clashing at protests – and hopefully build some trust. Rather than a government-run or policed system of registration for journalists, Hong Kong should consider setting up a self-regulatory journalists’ body, to liaise with police on safety and access issues, and keep student reporters safely away from the front lines.",Bernard Chan
"Why technology, not street vendors, will save China’s economy from coronavirus.

Asia’s real estate investors find escape from coronavirus in sheds and beds.

"Why market fears of an Air China takeover of Cathay Pacific proved  unfounded. The Cathay bailout was, in the end, remarkably similar to those of other airlines around the world.

"As it deals with China rivalry, the US must show it can still be trusted to stand by its allies in Asia. Asian nations have been disappointed by Washington’s lack of leverage over Beijing. There is a view that Donald Trump is adopting a hardline posture towards China for the upcoming presidential election, and might abandon Asian allies once victory is secured.",Lee Seong-hyon
Silence over Cathay Pacific bailout shows lawmakers are complicit in their own demise. Urgent matters such as the Cathay bailout and national security legislation being deemed too important for deliberation by the legislature raise questions over the use of having lawmakers at all. Why were they silent after making Ocean Park and its employees sweat for months over a much smaller bailout?,Alice Wu
Markets expecting an early coronavirus recovery are ignoring the global economic and political mess. The knowledge that a V-shaped recovery is off the table has not dissuaded markets from surging in expectation of further injections of central bank liquidity.

"Death of Hong Kong? Asia’s top financial hub can’t be ‘killed off’ by Macau, Hainan or even Shanghai.

"Western leaders have been quick to denounce Beijing’s national security law for Hong Kong. Too quick, actually.

"China’s ‘wolf warrior’ diplomats are being more reckless than Donald Trump. That’s a mistake.

Russia will not be Donald Trump’s tool in US diplomatic war against China. The US president’s recent suggestion of including Russia in an expanded G7 appears to be part of a ploy to make China look as though it is being abandoned by its partners.

"Why George Floyd protests do not mark the death of US soft power, despite China’s glee. The global marches show that many nations still identify with aspects of American culture and that America’s pluralistic society and values remain attractive. Conversely, the China story Beijing wants told has limited appeal to the rest of the world.",Robert Daly
"As George Floyd protests rage across the US, why does Donald Trump insist on posing in front of churches?. The US president wants to brand as terrorists all those protesting the killing of an African-American man by the police and is keen to use military force to quell demonstrations, using religion as the symbolic backdrop.",Robert Delaney
"For Hong Kong’s property market, the national security law is just one more uncertainty in an already uncertain time.

But Hong Kong remains important as an offshore funding platform for Chinese companies.",Nicholas Spiro
"Expect Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to escalate US-China tit-for-tat this year, with Hong Kong caught in the middle.

This pro-Hong Kong spirit is called for to ensure safeguards are built into the national security law to reassure the international community.",Vijay Verghese
"How hard can Donald Trump hit Hong Kong over the national security law? Not very. Even if the US levies a 25 per cent tariff levied on Hong Kong’s exports, that would affect only 0.1 per cent of GDP while imposing sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials is easier said than done.",David Dodwell

Coronavirus and trade war pushing China to focus on fixing economy rather than leading world order. The combination of Covid-19 and the trade war is pushing China’s leaders to focus on the domestic economy rather than filling the void left by a retreating United States. Stabilising rising unemployment and eradicating absolute poverty appear to be the government’s top priorities.,Yu Jie
"What do Trump’s base, China’s National People’s Congress and Hong Kong’s protest movement have in common? A human tendency towards bias.

The events in the US highlight the terrible consequences of insufficient checks and balances on police power. Using brute force only sows greater discontent, radicalisation and long-term instability. Addressing the causes of violence is harder but more effective.",Brian YS Wong
"Why downgrading English to boost China’s cultural confidence is a bad idea. National People’s Congress delegates have questioned the prominence of English at press conferences and in schools in China. But at a time when Covid-19 is aggravating anti-Chinese sentiment, China should stay open to cultural exchange.",Lijia Zhang
"Hong Kong must have faith that national security law will be clear and precise, to avoid misunderstandings. After trying Beijing’s patience for years with squabbling and political gridlock, Hong Kong must now be patient and have faith that the national security law will be implemented properly, with clear and precise wording.",Bernard Chan
"US unrest threatens to derail the post-lockdown recovery and catch markets flat-footed. The US protests are being exacerbated by a spreading epidemic and the worst recession since the 1930s.

"How Hong Kong got its coronavirus response right – by taking care of business. Although the handling of the national anthem and national security laws has been disappointing, Hong Kong has done an admirable job of coping with the economic crisis from the Covid-19 pandemic, as it struggles to contain a political crisis as well.",Peter G. de Krassel
"The coronavirus is highlighting Hong Kong’s wealth inequality. What’s the government doing about it?. The latest cluster involves warehouse workers, who probably don’t earn much more than the minimum wage. Why isn’t a city as wealthy as Hong Kong doing better by its population, and developing worthwhile jobs for people?",Richard Harris
"China’s national security law poses existential threat to Hong Kong’s universities and academic freedom. China’s tendency to use the vaguest, broadest terms in drafting its laws means research on several issues deemed too sensitive or falling under national security could become off-limits. This will be a strong disincentive for overseas academics to pursue research collaboration with their peers in Hong Kong.",Phil C. W. Chan
"China won’t back down on Hong Kong national security law or any other key issues, whatever the US threatens. The outrage of the US has never made Xi Jinping change his behaviour. If anything, it has only emboldened him. The national security law resolution is part of a broader strategy to reassert China’s territorial integrity.",Chi Wang

June 4 vigil is Hong Kong’s canary in a coal mine. Will it survive Beijing’s national security law?. Hong Kong’s response to the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown was seen as subversive and prompted Beijing to adopt a more hardline approach to the drafting of the Basic Law. Those effects are still being felt today.,Cliff Buddle
"Coronavirus’ huge hidden cost: millions of unborn babies across the world.

Why a national security law does not threaten Hong Kong’s autonomy or violate international agreements. Hong Kong has more autonomy than US states and strong protections for human rights. The proposed national security law is restricted to four crimes and is not the first regulation to be listed in Annex III of the Basic Law.,Song Xiaozhuang
Trump and the US should focus on George Floyd rather than Hong Kong and Tiananmen Square. American administrations have too often given in to the urge to stick their nose in other countries’ affairs without the intent or ability to follow through. The US would be better off dealing with its own inequality and inept governance than scolding Beijing over how it handles Hong Kong.,Tom Plate

"China’s relations with the US are at their lowest for 30 years, but don’t call it a new cold war.

"China-enacted national security law must be consistent with Hong Kong legal principles.

National security law: how a ‘burning’ Hong Kong wore out Beijing’s patience. Tensions have long simmered on Hong Kong’s journey of integration with the mainland: the long-running protests triggered by the extradition bill were the last straw. Carrie Lam and her opponents share blame for jeopardising the future of the city and its young people.,Anthony Cheung

"National security law: blue or yellow, Hong Kong lawmakers have let down Hongkongers. The protest movement and divisive politics have become Beijing’s justifications for the security law. The opposition and pro-Beijing camp helped put Hong Kong in this predicament, yet few are protecting Hongkongers’ interests now.",Alice Wu
Hong Kong has no one to blame but itself for Beijing’s intervention in national security legislation.

Trump’s bluster over the coronavirus and China fails to do his re-election hopes any favours. All the US president’s heated rhetoric and cries of conspiracy cannot change his administration’s shortcomings in responding to the coronavirus outbreak. Smearing China and his Democratic rival merely divert energy from the most pressing issues.,Brian P. Klein
"Distrust of China has blinded Hongkongers to Beijing’s intent in pushing a national security law for Hong Kong.

It comes after months of violent unrest and challenges to state power that have worried Beijing.",Ronny Tong
US outrage over national security law for Hong Kong puts Donald Trump and China trade talks in an awkward spot.

"Independent inquiry into Hong Kong protests remains best way to move forward.

"Why US-China decoupling is a dangerous mistake and tantamount to self-harm. The World Bank expects Covid-19 to impact commodities like oil and platinum, and even the Opec cartel itself.

"In the battle against the coronavirus, Japan and the four ‘tiger economies’ offer the world a new ‘Asian miracle’. The relatively low infection and death rates in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan are a testament to investment in public health infrastructure, transparency and societies that prioritise group interests.",Mark Clifford

"Cold War rivals fought disease together. Why not China and the US in the face of the coronavirus crisis?. During the Cold War, the USSR and the US worked together to develop a polio vaccine. Today, the US is more intent on killing off Chinese competition than working with China to avert economic depression.",Neal Kimberley
"Donald Trump’s coronavirus ramblings don’t merit the US media spotlight when expert opinion is the need of the hour. The US president has become the focus of his long-winded press conferences, while crucial medical information – such as the effectiveness of hydryoxychloroquine in treating Covid-19 – is in short supply.",Robert Delaney
"Economic recovery is certain even after the worst hit – the coronavirus crisis will be no different. The optimism of the US stock rally last week may look misplaced, but the nature of economic cycles should give confidence that the world will bounce back – even if the recovery is more likely to be gradual and U-shaped, than sharp and V-shaped.",David Brown
"Coronavirus takes a heavy toll on the world’s most expensive office market – Hong Kong’s Central district. The disruption caused by Covid-19 is not only exacerbating the vulnerabilities of the city’s office market, but earlier sources of resilience are also being compromised.",Nicholas Spiro

"How China is losing the world’s trust following its cover-up of the coronavirus crisis. Beijing failed to go public with the true scale of the pandemic, hampering other nations’ ability to respond in time. China’s rise on the global stage was made possible by the goodwill of the rest of the world, and trust that had been hard earned should not be so easily squandered.",Chi Wang
"Carrie Lam has finally done a good job on coronavirus relief. Pity about her belated pay cut announcement though.

"Demonising China does nothing to untangle the contesting claims on South China Sea’s fish-rich waters. Rampant illegal fishing – by flagged vessels from many nations, not just China – has made the problem more complex. Data on arrests over illegal fishing show China is far from being the worst aggressor, and painting it as such only further muddies the water.",Mark J. Valencia
"The cold, hard maths of whether a coronavirus shutdown is worth everyone’s loss of quality of life. If we go into lockdown every year, we can prevent many deaths from flu.

No room for complacency as Hong Kong fights to end the coronavirus surge and avoid a ‘third wave’. The city was not alone in being hit by a ‘second wave’ of infections last month as Hongkongers returned sick from abroad and locally transmitted cases also shot up.,Bernard Chan
"Why markets are making a big mistake in assuming the coronavirus threat is receding and betting on recovery. While the virus-induced slide into global recession was rapid, the resumption of economic activity will be anything but. Markets have seized on signs that infection rates are slowing, but actual economic recovery remains a distant prospect.",Nicholas Spiro
"Hong Kong’s Basic Law may be conflicting and confusing – but it’s still the best system for relations with China. For all its flaws, the Basic Law protects Hong Kong’s separate system and can continue to do so beyond 2047, provided work begins now to resolve some of the deep-rooted contradictions.

"China’s coronavirus success shows up poor pandemic preparedness in the rest of the world.

With decoupling in trade and technology proceeding apace, China’s focus on this critical component of its hi-tech development reflects a desire to be self-sufficient. But technology warfare based on techno-nationalism benefits no one in the end.",Dieter Ernst
"As other economies panic over Covid-19, China can bide its time and stimulate its way to the future. Other economies brought out the big guns last month, but not China. It is cautious about an all-out stimulus package, after experiencing side effects of the previous round. Instead, Beijing should formulate a forward-looking stimulus programme.",Aidan Yao
"For the coronavirus-stricken West, blaming China is a dangerous waste of time. Consigning the problem to ‘the other’ – China’s regime and culture – has just bred negligence and hubris in the West, which contributed to delays in containing the outbreak and wasted the precious head start China won with its draconian lockdowns.",Bai Tongdong
"US-China war of words over the coronavirus crisis may well reignite the trade war. As the White House moves to systematically reduce US trade dependencies on China, the pandemic is putting pressure on the implementation of the terms of the phase-one deal even before the difficult phase-two negotiations begin. The uneasy US-China truce is unlikely to last long.",Stephen Olson
"Why the coronavirus pandemic is unlikely to change the world, for better or worse. Stalked by Covid-19, countries and politicians have in effect become exaggerated versions of themselves. This suggests that the crisis may turn out to be less of a watershed in global politics and economics than many have argued.",Dani Rodrik
"The record shows China has risen to the coronavirus challenge admirably, whatever the US may believe. Mistakes were made in the early days, including attempts to block information and impede investigations at home, but Beijing has been upfront with the international community about Covid-19.",Winston Mok
"Hong Kong’s paltry coronavirus relief is cold comfort to the jobless and needy. If officials think that with a HK$10,000 cash handout, they have done their duty, they are sadly mistaken.

"Why the Trump administration’s case against China’s mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak does not hold up.

In such extraordinary circumstances, forecasts and predictions by clever computers or AI-driven algorithms cannot provide specific solutions. These can only come about by putting our smartest thinkers together through multilateral action and global cooperation.",David Dodwell

"From quarantine breakers to social distancing avoiders, ingenuity is turning out to be the weakest link in our coronavirus defence. Human ingenuity is prevailing, not just in helping people get used to difficult pandemic measures, but also in circumventing them. Apathy, dangerously, is also a form of adaptation, to prevent oneself from being overwhelmed in these extreme times.",Samir Nazareth
"The US and China should fight the coronavirus together now, and quarrel later. There will be time to dwell on how much China’s initial cover-up and the US government’s slow response to Covid-19 cost the world.

"Coronavirus pandemic could be an economic policy turning point, reconfiguring the public-private nexus. The zero-interest rate environment is likely to continue long after the crisis abates and government debt will balloon. Governments will have to make difficult decision on which companies to save, without upsetting the principle of market forces.",Tai Hui
"The world simply can’t afford China-style coronavirus lockdowns. Mass containment has become the narrative of the coronavirus pandemic, but is it really the answer? From an economic perspective, it makes more sense to actively protect vulnerable people, and get everyone else back to work.",Richard Harris
"As the coronavirus rocks financial markets worldwide, China is not the safe bet investors hope it is. While Chinese stock market, yuan and bond markets have proved resilient, it is too early to say whether China will be hit by a second wave of infections, and the strain on global supply chains does not bode well for the country.",Nicholas Spiro

So, 28 days without local infections should be enough for a city to be declared safe.",Ho Lok Sang
"For India to become the next manufacturing powerhouse, it must first learn from China – with or without the coronavirus. The crippling disruption to Chinese supply lines has inspired talk of India capitalising on Covid-19 to boost its ‘Make in India’ push. But the challenge of setting up a suitable supply network, with the skilled workforce to operate it, is daunting even before India went into a lockdown of its own.",Keji Mao

"Beijing must come clean on arbitrary detention of Taiwanese or risk hurting its soft power ambitions.

Why the ‘big bazooka’ used in the 2008 financial meltdown is the wrong weapon for the coronavirus crisis.

It cannot be the answer for a world facing a shock stemming from deficiencies in the quality of that growth.,Stephen Roach
"No room for coronavirus conceit from US or China as world has its hands full fighting pandemic. It is too simplistic to credit China’s containment to authoritarianism, just as America’s failings cannot be blamed on democracy.

To avert fresh upset, she should emphasis her government’s transitional nature.",Vijay Verghese

"With the coronavirus beginning to exact its economic cost, Hong Kong must brace itself for a tide of woe.

"As Europe’s coronavirus death rate climbs, China’s recovery from the epidemic has become a bellwether for investor sentiment. If economic activity resumes in China without triggering renewed clusters of outbreaks, investors will conclude that aggressive containment measures can be successful and they will have clarity on the depth and duration of the crisis.",Nicholas Spiro

"Coronavirus has only hastened the inevitable stock market crash, but expect another bull run on the back of stimulus measures.

The coronavirus will not be fatal for China’s Belt and Road Initiative but it will strike a heavy blow. Projects face delays as the coronavirus prevents Beijing from supplying the goods and people needed. And project resources will be diverted as China focuses on its own recovery.

"Why the coronavirus is a ticking time bomb in the US: a costly and inefficient health care system.

"The coronavirus epidemic is a warning for Hong Kong, and others, to prepare for the reality of an ageing world. Because the coronavirus disproportionately affects people over 65, health care systems in countries with large elderly populations are struggling. The pandemic should prompt governments to consider how policies such as social distancing affect the elderly.",Colleen K. Howe
"As markets panic over coronavirus pandemic, the US dollar is king – for the time being.

The worry is that the US may strike a withdrawal deal with China in the South China Sea, carving up the disputed waters in a sort of Guam Doctrine.",William Choong
"Complacency risks undoing Hong Kong’s good work in containing coronavirus. This is no time to let our guard down, when there are asymptomatic Covid-19 spreaders, a shortage of protective equipment for medical workers, and the catastrophic possibility of a rise in cases overwhelming stretched hospitals.",Manimala Dharmangadan
"Three ways the coronavirus could trigger a global financial crisis – and why central bankers are to blame. Heavily leveraged tourism-related companies such as airlines, the commercial real estate sector and the residential property market are all vulnerable pressure points. Cutting interest rates will not help these sectors, but it will boost speculation.",Andy Xie
"China has actively worked with the WHO to fight the coronavirus. Now, other countries should too. China’s lockdown measures have helped slow the international spread of Covid-19. As the epidemic enters a new phase, China should continue to support the WHO’s global disease control efforts by sharing data, experience and innovation.",Tang Bei
"The coronavirus crisis is changing how we work, travel and shop. That might just save our planet. The Covid-19 epidemic has forced lifestyle changes, such as reductions in air travel and conspicuous consumption, that will benefit our planet. The Hong Kong government should take forward the ‘smart city’ changes people have been forced to adopt.",Ian Brownlee
"US-fuelled climate change, not China, is the greatest threat to the global economy and the world. China’s per capita emissions are less than half the US’ and it is moving towards renewable energy. Meanwhile, the US accounts for twice China’s cumulative emissions in modern times but has pulled out of the Paris Agreement and remains committed to fossil fuels.",Winston Mok

US Fed rate cut alone won’t steady a global economy shaken by the coronavirus. The dramatic spike in demand for safe-haven 10-year Treasuries is a sign that markets expect more from the Fed – it must ensure access to US dollar liquidity remains open.,Neal Kimberley
"Another Wuhan could emerge as the coronavirus travels the world. Are politicians, including Donald Trump, prepared?. The insights of quantum physics urge us to contemplate the unthinkable, and such out-of-the-box thinking is just what’s needed to get the epidemic under control. We had better trust science, rather than politics, to lead us out of the crisis.",Tom Plate
"As a global economic storm gathers, even Singapore may no longer be a safe haven for investors. Singapore’s commercial property market surged last year largely because of foreign capital inflows. But this is now a liability, as cross-border investors take a sterner view of the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy.",Nicholas Spiro
"The coronavirus crisis should trigger a turn to caring capitalism through a united global policy response. Rather than focusing on interest rate cuts, major economies must coordinate policy action, along the lines of the Marshall Plan, to propel growth in the less-developed world.

While mask wearing is still ubiquitous, more Hongkongers are venturing out to restaurants and social gatherings. Meanwhile, Covid-19 continues to spread and the risk of contracting it is still high.",Peter Kammerer
"Donald Trump’s embrace of India’s Narendra Modi is a picture of US double standards in its trade war with China. India’s protectionism and its human rights infringements attract much less open criticism from the US than China’s. Perhaps, the US’ targeting of China is more about Beijing’s success in shifting the global balance of power.",David Dodwell
"Coronavirus concerns aside, powerful trends point to boom time for Asian tech.

"Covid-19: the one lesson Hong Kong has yet to learn from Sars – leadership communication. Post-Sars standard operating procedures clearly work and the Hong Kong government has performed reasonably well in dealing with Covid-19, except in communicating a clear crisis narrative so people know what is being done and what to do.",Anthony Cheung

"The coronavirus is bringing a painful but much-needed end to an era of economic excess. The global economy and its credit-fuelled markets have a long way to fall and things will not return to normal after the epidemic. The hope is that governments, forced to spend to boost the economy, will invest sustainably and target inequality.",Anthony Rowley
"Has Hong Kong reached a turning point, as a district council backs away from ugly politics?. Proposals to name parks after two late young Hongkongers reeked of political exploitation. When the Sai Kung District Council finally suspended discussions on the park-naming motions, it was a small victory for a better kind of politics.",Alice Wu
"Coronavirus vs Trump: the US president’s authoritarian bluster has hit the cold, hard wall of a disease he can’t control. From the Trump administration’s disbanding of the National Security Council’s epidemic response team to the president’s garbled messaging and the convoluted organisation of his coronavirus task force, the buck will finally stop at the very top.",Brian P. Klein
"Hong Kong doesn’t just need more housing, it must also find more ways to turn renters into owners. The government’s backing for Lantau Tomorrow, reaffirmed in the budget speech, is a pragmatic solution to increasing the housing supply. At the same time, the government must boost the home ownership rate to give more people a stake in society.",Mike Rowse
International Women’s Day: how gender diversity at the top can give corporate Hong Kong a competitive edge. Hong Kong’s high cost of living has made two-income families the norm. The city has a good child-care support system and is relatively open to women leaders. Diversity in the workplace is much needed to address today’s challenging macroeconomic environment.,Eva Chau

"As Hong Kong celebrates International Women’s Day, everyone can play a part in closing the gender gap. With employers still biased against mothers, one in seven women a victim of sexual violence and too many unrealistic gender stereotypes, Hong Kong needs to work towards becoming gender equal – an improvement for both men and women.",Fiona Nott
"Why a Joe Biden nomination in the US presidential race is unlikely to reassure China. The former US vice-president now looks the strongest contender for the Democratic nomination after his Super Tuesday victories. But even if he goes on to beat Trump, a return to the China-friendly policies of the Obama era seems unlikely.",Drew Thompson
"Why Vietnam will not replace China any time soon as the world’s manufacturing hub. Not only are global companies heavily invested in Chinese manufacturing operations, they also have an eye on the country’s massive consumer market. Countries in South and Southeast Asia cannot match China’s manufacturing capacity and infrastructure.",David Dodwell
What’s ailing Hong Kong? Not just coronavirus-induced panic but also months of mental stress. The Covid-19 outbreak comes at a time when mental health in Hong Kong is at its most fragile in eight years.

Families are unable to plan, with uncertainty over school closures, just as businesses need a clearer vision of how the government plans to ensure Hong Kong’s continued success.",Tara Joseph
"As Carrie Lam and Beijing tighten their grip, Hong Kong must rely on its independent judiciary. Hongkongers must see Jimmy Lai’s arrest for what it is: a clampdown on the city’s cherished freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Equally ominous is the government’s bundling of the HK$10,000 cash handouts with more police funding.",Albert Cheng
How China’s coronavirus crisis exposes the Achilles’ heel of Communist Party power. The party’s initial mishandling of the outbreak has eroded support among China’s urban middle class. The brief but intense eruption of public criticism is a taste of how such missteps can threaten the social contract on which the party’s legitimacy is built.,Minxin Pei
"Coronavirus crisis is exacerbating long-standing stock market vulnerabilities – bad news is no longer good news. Markets read the US Federal Reserve’s emergency rate cut as a sign of panic, resulting in last week’s correction, but stocks are still overvalued. Global growth fears have chipped away at market confidence, with investors pricing in a recession.",Nicholas Spiro
"Asia must brace for short-term volatility as Covid-19 hits China and South Korea harder than expected.

Harris
"Why the Fed’s latest rate cut is an overreaction and sends the wrong signal to markets. The emergency rate cut, its first since the 2008 global financial crisis, reinforces fears that the world economy is in trouble, and may yet send record low Treasury yields into negative territory.",Richard Harris
"Chinese who cry racial abuse amid the coronavirus epidemic forget they are as bad as the rest of us. We’re all racists, it’s just a matter of degree. If The Wall Street Journal’s ‘Sick Man of Asia’ headline was racist, was it more offensive than the CCTV variety show featuring blackface? Unlike China, at least the US admits it has a problem.",Michael Chugani

Four coronavirus-driven Chinese consumer trends that will last even after the epidemic has subsided. The outbreak has hastened the transition to e-commerce and accelerated the use of AI and robotics.

Last week’s jump in the yen reflects the unwinding of yen-funded long positions in US equities, not confidence in the Japanese economy or currency. Coronavirus-related disruption to global supply chains and a drop in tourism will hit Japan’s economy hard.",Neal Kimberley
"Coronavirus must push the US and China to pause strategic competition in favour of a coordinated war on the epidemic.

Coronavirus crisis? Trump’s bromance with Xi is going strong and he can blame everything on the Democrats anyway. The US president has suggested that investors are panicking not because of Covid-19 but because of the Democratic presidential debates. It’s doubtful that even the Chinese propaganda machine could stretch the truth that far.,Robert Delaney
"Life after Covid-19: how we travel, socialise and form economic supply chains must change for good. Once the epidemic is successfully controlled in China, the government should impose strict quarantine measures on incoming visitors to prevent a second wave of infection. Globally, health declarations should in future be required of all travellers, while economies must begin to diversify their sources of goods and services.",Lawrence J. Lau

"Markets are finally waking up to the coronavirus crisis, as hopes of a V-shaped recovery fade.

Why the world must avoid returning to ‘normal’ if and when the coronavirus crisis winds down. The world must change in the aftermath of the epidemic.

"Paul Chan’s budget should ease the pain of the coronavirus crisis in Hong Kong, but not much more. Under great pressure to be generous with our ample reserves, the financial secretary must keep in mind that Hong Kong faces two other major challenges apart from a virus outbreak.

"How China is losing global trust and goodwill over its handling of the coronavirus crisis. The crisis could have been a turning point in Beijing’s quest to be a reliable world power.

Neither Donald Trump nor Xi Jinping can escape blame for their national crises. The difference is Americans can vote out Trump.

"Coronavirus holds up a mirror to China’s problems, and the nation will be the better for it.

"Amid the coronavirus crisis, China is paying a high price for its authoritarian system. While blame for the epidemic cannot be pinned solely on the Chinese government’s attempts to control and manipulate information, its heavy-handed approach has further eroded public trust. Beijing should beware the high price of an authoritarian regime.",Wenfang Tang
"Coronavirus chaos can prompt a needed rethink on global trade and economic integration.

"The coronavirus was no black swan. Hong Kong and China just weren’t ready for a crisis.

Travel bans are useless to stop an outbreak. Beijing says the United States has ‘inappropriately overreacted’ to the coronavirus outbreak by imposing travel bans. Washington counters that its response is ‘science-based’. Who’s right?,Alex Lo
"Have Trump’s aggressive trade policies been more successful than Reagan’s at cutting the US trade deficit?. Both Trump and Reagan made tackling the US trade deficit a priority and moved to protect competitive interests. Trump’s deficit is bigger and his policy moves are louder and clearer but, as US influence wanes, it may be time for a more enlightened policy direction.",Michael Czinkota
"Coronavirus travel bans: shutting the door on China now will hurt goodwill and cooperation in the future. A blanket travel ban on Chinese nationals is too radical and treats all of China as an epidemic-stricken region. Such an attitude will only compromise cooperation with China, and turn off Chinese visitors, including overseas students unable to return to their universities in time.",James Liang
"Biased Western reporting on the coronavirus may have a nasty side effect: a new wave of Chinese nationalism. Some Western media outlets have invoked the ‘yellow peril’ in their coverage of a ‘Made in China’ virus.

Carrie Lam can turn the coronavirus crisis into an opportunity to wipe the slate clean and remake Hong Kong. The chief executive can win hearts and minds by completely closing the border with the mainland and announcing an independent inquiry into the protests.

"Are we overreacting to the coronavirus threat and merely creating bigger risks down the road?. For a coronavirus with a lower fatality rate than peak flu season in the US, millions are quarantined, borders are closed, flights are cut, and economic and political costs are mounting.

"Despite the US-China trade war deal, investors should brace for a widening chasm between the two countries. The US and China are likely to adopt divergent economic approaches and different attitudes to international engagement.

The unique role Hong Kong has played for at least the past century is disappearing as mainland cities such as Shenzhen and Guangzhou emerge as leaders.

If the euro rallies against the dollar, there are important implications for China’s currency reserve management.",David Brown
"How the phase one US-China trade deal moves the world closer to a G2 global order. As China grows stronger, it has less need for multilateral institutions.

"Hong Kong, preoccupied with its extradition crisis and trying to ‘be water’, overlooked the climate emergency. Hong Kong, grappling with protests for half of 2019, was somewhat out of tune with the global zeitgeist, which was focused on how to combat the threat of climate change.",David Dodwell
China’s central bank eases into 2020 with a firm grip on loose liquidity. While policy easing remains – with falling lending rates and a cut to the reserve requirement ratio – investors should not expect a flood of liquidity. The 2020 prognosis? Loose but prudent monetary policy.,Hannah Anderson

"Taiwan’s new anti-infiltration law seeks to curb Chinese communist influence, but it may end up hurting democracy. While supporters point to Chinese misinformation campaigns to justify the law and point to its narrow scope, the way it was rushed through and the chilling effect it will have on freedom of speech and cross-strait exchanges are cause for concern.",Chiu-Ti Jansen
"In 2020, voters everywhere must reject policies that cut public spending only to enrich the wealthy. When the neoliberal policies of old failed us, it has been the far right that seized on the public discontent to make political gains. But the solutions they offer are broken, and voters must demand public investments that actually benefit people.",Isabel Ortiz
"A rising China will not become a global aggressor – it has too much to lose and enough space to transform. While some fear that resurgent communist ideology will undo China’s gains and spark aggression towards other nations, this is unlikely because of how enmeshed China’s economy is with the West.",Ian Inkster

"Don’t believe the absurd conspiracy theories: there’s no way people could have been killed in Hong Kong without anyone speaking out. A whistle-blower culture is taking hold around the world. So, even with scepticism about the official line, it is puzzling that some in Hong Kong still believe there were deaths in an MTR station even though no one has come forward.",Bernard Chan
"With markets primed for a reversal, here are five events that could trigger a 2020-21 financial crisis. While the trade war and possibility of a global recession remain concerns, a liquidity crisis in which everyone wants to redeem their debt at the same time – such as severe problems in a major economy like China – is what we should fear most.",Richard Harris
"Continuing unrest makes Hong Kong’s poor poorer and helps no one. The absolute number of people in poverty grew in 2018, even though the economy made gains then. The impact of the protests will surely be felt in new poverty figures, as more people lose their jobs.",Paul Yip
"A New Year’s resolution for Hong Kong’s protesters, police and government: account for the collateral damage of your actions.

China’s banking debt crisis is a ticking time bomb that must be defused with urgent financial-sector reforms. The spate of bank rescues from Baoshang to HengFeng is only the tip of the iceberg as slowing economic growth unearths more bad loans. The monetary fixes of the 1990s do not work without hypergrowth. The only solution? Unflinching banking-sector reforms.,Hans Yue Zhu

"Only a China-Russia alliance could revive a ‘brain-dead’ Nato. But with that unlikely, the transatlantic alliance may be on its last legs. Nato’s fatal problem is it has no real enemy, with Russia a spent force and terrorism a vaguely defined threat.

How the US trade war brings out China’s best hopes and worst fears for its economy. China’s trade and tariff war with the US is its biggest economic threat with growth now expected to slip below the psychologically important 6 per cent figure. Yet the possibility of comprehensive US-China trade deals also underpins Beijing’s hopes of returning to sustainable growth.,Cary Huang
"With the phase one trade deal, China’s economic fortunes look more rosy for 2020. The same can’t be said about Japan’s. China’s economy is showing signs of recovery. But Japan faces serious problems, even with an Olympic boost to the economy. For one thing, the phase one US-China trade deal may well hurt Japan’s manufacturers.",Neal Kimberley

"With global confidence returning, a stock market boom is on the cards for 2020. As the trade war recedes, investors will feel better about market prospects.

"Over six months of protests, Hong Kong’s leaders may have been ‘too simple, too naive’. The deep divisions in society since Occupy have only hardened over the recent protests.

"The trade war, North Korea’s nuclear provocations and Hong Kong’s protests all show what happens when ‘principle’ triumphs over reason. Unyielding principles are often indistinguishable from stubbornness, especially when it results in diplomatic disaster. All sides in the North Korean nuclear talks, the US-China rivalry and Hong Kong have shown unwillingness to compromise.",Tom Plate

"Brexit once sent London property prices sinking but may now boost them. Will this last?. Hard Brexit or not, greater clarity on Britain’s political future is making London’s property market appealing to investors, not least those from Hong Kong.

US-China decoupling would spell the end of globalisation and China’s growth story. Decoupling has started but the signing of a phase-one US-China trade deal holds out hope that Washington is not ready to fully unfurl protectionism even as Beijing is unprepared for complete self-reliance.,Cary Huang
"Hong Kong protesters must focus on attainable goals, such as MPF pension reforms, which Beijing cannot argue against. A Western-style democracy is a lost cause but protesters can retain popular support if they push for solutions to social welfare issues such as pensions. Pan-democrats working alongside Beijing will make loftier goals more achievable down the road.",Peter Kammerer
"Boris Johnson’s election victory in Brexit Britain shows the way for a gridlocked Hong Kong. The sweeping Conservative victory shows that democratic processes can break political gridlocks. Hongkongers, too, want an end to the uncertainty on the city’s autonomy come 2047 and the city desperately needs charismatic leaders to take up the conversation with Beijing.",David Dodwell

Carrie Lam’s successor must be able to win over Beijing and the Hong Kong public. Two candidates come to mind. Lam’s successor must have credibility with Beijing but also a finger on the pulse of popular sentiment in Hong Kong. Only former Legco presidents Jasper Tsang and Rita Fan have the broad appeal needed to solve pressing problems Lam will leave incomplete.,Mike Rowse
"Protests show Carrie Lam should offer her resignation, and Beijing should accept it. But who would ever want her job?. The present crisis shows Hong Kong needs a new leader, one who respects China and is respected in China. However, this leader must also fight for Hong Kong, and not merely tell Beijing what it wants to hear.",Kevin Rafferty
"How much damage has Carrie Lam done to Hong Kong politics since 2016? Beijing must keep count.

"Hong Kong’s hopes and fears are not Taiwan’s – and its protests are a distraction for Taiwanese voters. Owing to Hong Kong’s colonial history and role in global affairs, the city’s relationship with Beijing is vastly different from the equally complex cross-strait relations.

"From Trump’s America to Brexit and Hong Kong’s protesters, politics triumphs over economics – but only up to a point. Donald Trump’s pressure on the Fed, Brexit and Hong Kong’s protests have one thing in common: the actions are more beneficial politically than economically. But, given Hong Kong’s importance to China’s economy, Beijing’s response to the protests shows playing politics has its limits.",Richard Harris

"Russia is no friend to China. In fact, Xi’s friendship with Putin is a betrayal of the Chinese people. Russia has little to offer China, other than a means to antagonise the US. Xi’s courtship of Moscow makes no sense because it ignores the animosity that has defined Sino-Russian relations since the Treaty of Nerchinsk in the 17th century.",Chi Wang
"Human rights are universal, which is why the United States stands with Hong Kong.

"Hong Kong has billions in fiscal firepower but, with a lack of credible governance, the city is powerless to fight a recession. Hong Kong is in recession, confidence levels are at a historic low, and yet the government is spending less than 1 per cent of the city’s GDP on recovery. Then again, the Carrie Lam administration might lack the credibility to do more.",Nicholas Spiro
"As Xinjiang makes international news, China’s counterattacks against the US miss the mark. Beijing is right that US history is far from blameless and Washington is overzealous in labelling China a ‘threat’.

"Anti-government victory in Hong Kong’s district council elections won’t bring about peace.

"Sensible political reforms the Hong Kong government can offer for the 2020 Legco election and beyond. The government has no excuse to delay the political reforms Hongkongers are clearly demanding. Sensible first steps include breaking up bigger constituencies and abolishing corporate voting in the Legco election, and making the chief executive nominating committee more representative.",Mike Rowse
"The Hong Kong protests are a quarrel over values. Beijing must find a wise answer to it.

Hong Kong pro-democracy bloc’s mandate is clear – focus on community work but keep the protest flag flying.

"How Hong Kong’s protest crisis may have already sealed Tsai Ing-wen’s victory in Taiwan’s presidential election.

Shutting down the city would sever China’s access to global financial services, bring on sanctions and spark countries to join the US’ effort to contain China.",Minxin Pei
"Carrie Lam has lit Hong Kong ablaze. A failure to hold district council elections would be the final betrayal. Carrie Lam, and the pro-Beijing politicians who enabled her, should not forget their responsibility for the protest chaos. If elections do not happen as scheduled, the increased violence will take a toll that the city will not recover from.","Phil C. W. Chan,Wilson Leung"

"Overseas universities, not trade war, are the front line of China's rivalry with Western democracies.

"The trade war’s end would bring huge dividends to China, the US and the global economy at large. China’s economy could return to 7 per cent annually, the US could near 4 and the global economy could go back to 5. But this would depend not just on the trade war ending, but appropriate stimulus and reform measures afterwards.",David Brown
"Hong Kong protests are pushing the city’s commercial property market off a cliff, and sellers are in denial. Transaction volumes in Hong Kong’s commercial real estate investment sector have plunged in the third quarter, with mainland investors making no purchases. The protests have accentuated vulnerabilities in the sector, such as low rental yields.",Nicholas Spiro
"Mike Pence’s China speech had two messages – and two audiences – along with some good news on the trade war. The US vice-president’s speech had two tasks: reassure financial markets ahead of the 2020 election while also rousing Trump’s political base. Red meat thrown to the latter crowd made headlines and irritated Beijing, but the speech also left leeway on a trade deal.",Douglas H. Paal

"Hong Kong protests reveal a government failing to protect its citizens’ economic and social well-being.

"The sad irony in Hong Kong protesters’ fight for democratic freedoms. Protesters in Hong Kong are demanding greater democratic freedoms when democracies across the Western world are increasingly in crisis, as the rule of law starts looking like the rule of the “swarm”. This mob democracy cannot be what Hong Kong really wants.",Andrew Sheng
"If Hong Kong is to have a future as a plural society, both sides must say no to violence.

"The trade war’s damage is done in Asia, and even an interim US-China deal can’t undo the past year.

"Forget the mask ban. Beijing can solve Hong Kong’s protests by letting a governor run the city. Taking a hard line won’t work, yet doing nothing is not an option. Why not amend the Basic Law, perhaps jointly with the UK, to bring in a tried-and-tested fix? A governor can rebalance the local vested interests and focus on improving people’s welfare.",Richard Harris
"Carrie Lam’s mask ban is an ineffective stick for violent protesters. Where’s the carrot for moderate protesters?.

"Donald Trump’s impeachment crisis may be China’s latest stroke of luck, blunting the US’ most serious challenge to its rise.

"China and the US have perhaps their last chance to end the trade war. Otherwise, get ready for global economic turmoil.

"The violence won’t end if Hongkongers would prefer to take their chances with the mob rather than side with Carrie Lam.

"From US-China trade war to ‘foreign interference’, the nation-state system is ailing and needs a reset. Donald Trump’s call for China’s assistance to investigate a political rival, at a point when bilateral relations are at a critically low ebb, raises alarm bells, and more questions about the sustainability of the Westphalian nation-state order.",Tom Plate
"Hong Kong’s protests are rooted in something deeper than the economy or foreign interference: they’re about fear and identity. A large number of today’s Hongkongers fled from China during the Cultural Revolution, and protests reflect the trauma felt by them, and their descendants, at the lack of choice about their identity after 1997.",Chris Lonsdale
"Hong Kong’s economy has so far weathered the protests and US-China trade war, but anti-mask law may be the tipping point. Hong Kong is not Argentina – its financial buffers are strong and the damage of the past few months is not permanent.

"Hong Kong’s government needs short- and long-term solutions to the protest crisis – what it can’t do is wait indefinitely.

To counter this, the government should go beyond cosmetic solutions to address people’s aspirations and the real causes of their angst.",Chiu-Ti Jansen
"Why Iran has got China wrong: Beijing will follow its own playbook in countering the US-led West. While regional players like Iran seek to bring China into the conversation, Beijing continues to rely on the rhetoric of non-interference. Its single-minded focus on its own interests will see China become stronger.",Raffaello Pantucci
"In the rush to demonise China over trade, the West has failed to give Beijing enough credit for its green leadership. China is focusing on sustainability at a point when its per capita output is barely more than one-third that of advanced economies. A relatively poor country has made a conscious choice to shift from the quantity to the quality of growth.",Stephen Roach
"Beijing should not take any chances with the slowing economy. The recent boost to monetary and fiscal easing is a step in the right direction, but more action is needed, given the mounting risks.

And for Hong Kong, recent deaths that have been blamed on the local crisis show the need for reconciliation.",Paul Yip

"Inverted yield curves may alarm Donald Trump and the wealthy, but it’s just more stagnation and inequality for the rest of us. Low interest rates after the 2008 crisis limit our response to the next recession, but that’s not the only problem. For those who aren’t wealthiest of the wealthy, prevailing low interest rates have meant salaries stagnate and savings evaporate.",David Dodwell

"With any luck, Hong Kong’s ninja protesters will hang up their masks and the summer of discontent will pass. To keep things in perspective, the Hong Kong protests have been less self-destructive than Brexit. With Carrie Lam’s withdrawal of the extradition bill, the city may have a slim chance of returning to calm and restarting political reform.",David Dodwell
"Carrie Lam listened to 19 Hong Kong elites after ignoring millions of marchers in June – that’s why the bill withdrawal has solved nothing. Had Carrie Lam listened to the public on June 9, Hong Kong’s summer of discontent could have been avoided. Now, by showing she does value the views of a few elites, she has inflicted more pain on the city, her allies included.",Alice Wu

As political dramas unfold, fast-moving currency markets will continue to release value for shrewd investors.",Hannah Anderson
"Liberal or conservative, Hongkongers must learn to listen to those they disagree with. At the fundamental level, the protests are disagreements over values. If the city is to reach closure, people on both sides of the divide must have the sophistication to listen to the other side and spot opportunities for give and take.","Michael B. Wong,Spike W. S. Lee"
"The trade war has changed US-China ties forever, so Beijing is building bridges to the EU through the belt and road. The trade conflict will more likely than not end in a stalemate, sending Beijing scrambling for sophisticated partners. China’s overtures to Europe make sense in this light, since Donald Trump has not shown the foresight to counter them.",Anthony Rowley
"Carrie Lam has bought time with Hong Kong extradition bill withdrawal: now she must find the means of change.

Hong Kong’s Lion Rock spirit of helping one another is under attack, just as the city needs it most amid the widening divisions in society triggered by the extradition law.",Albert Cheng
"At long last, Carrie Lam has heeded one call from Hong Kong protesters: it’s not much, but it’s a start. After three months of sometimes violent protests, the government has relented on the extradition bill. But, for the city to truly move on, it must end the silence on alleged police abuses, put universal suffrage back on the agenda, and examine why young people are angry with Beijing.",Cliff Buddle

This is especially so given the protests in Hong Kong and deteriorating cross-strait relations.",Chen Long
"Good news for Hong Kong in leaked Carrie Lam tape: a solution to the unrest is at hand. The tape proved that Lam and Beijing are both keen to see ‘one country, two systems’ thrive, but it must work both ways. For a return to peaceful prosperity, all Hong Kong needs is for Lam to swallow her pride and her financial officials to loosen the purse strings.",Richard Harris
"Why US claims that China is a currency manipulator are groundless. The yuan has appreciated significantly since the global financial crisis, and a review of China’s policy decisions show that it has, in fact, done more than any other major economy to honour its commitment to hold the value of its currency.",Guan Tao
"Why Trump picked the wrong fight with his designation of China as a currency manipulator. The Chinese central bank’s decision to let the yuan fall below 7 per US dollar had little to do with trade or currency wars.

China pushes ahead with deleveraging and tightening standards to avoid systemic risks, while the US seeks stimulus. These approaches appear opposite, but both are about girding up to maintain an advantage in the trade war.",Hao Zhou
"Tiananmen’s lesson: if Hong Kong’s protesters want a fight, Beijing will certainly give it to them.

Hong Kong has a China problem: we don’t talk and think deeply about the mainland in our universities. Universities in Hong Kong need to have a conversation about China that goes beyond Mandarin and business opportunities. The lack of research into contemporary China only benefits nativists and colonial-era nostalgists in Hong Kong.,Daniel Vukovich
"For all Hong Kong’s sake, Carrie Lam must reach out to the peaceful majority, to isolate the radicals and halt the violence.

"China damages its brand when it co-opts celebrities into its One-China, pro-police propaganda drive.

"When Hong Kong civil servants protest too, can China still blame American ‘black hands’ for the unrest?. With 1,400 US companies in Hong Kong, Washington has little to gain from increased political risk in the city.

Hong Kong’s fear over the extradition law is neither unique nor new. Remember the Treaty of Wanghia.

US-China trade war hawks are right on one count: the WTO is in sore need of reform (just not in the way they imagine). Rather than seeking to counter export competition from China’s state-owned enterprises – as espoused by the US and some EU nations – the WTO should fundamentally rethink its rules to accommodate different economic systems.,Anthony Rowley
"Can a grand dialogue help people reflect and heal a divided Hong Kong? Maybe. Dare we hold one? Probably not.

"Wealthy financial markets must start to pay their way to help the poor, and a global ‘Robin Hood’ tax is the way to do so. When financial markets crashed in 2008, central banks were quick to slash interest rates and print money. The subsequent financial boom was basically subsidised by taxpayers. Now it’s time financial markets returned the favour.",David Brown
"To win the ‘battle for Hong Kong’, Beijing must stop treating it as just another Chinese city. Hongkongers will not stand for the routine style of mainland governance.

"Lessons from Hong Kong’s protests: Carrie Lam is a liability, the leadership selection process doesn’t work, but the right kind of demonstration can. Hong Kong’s protesters should remember they have succeeded so far because of Carrie Lam’s political ineptitude in seeking to rush the extradition bill through the legislature, and because their resistance hasn’t directly challenged Beijing or the Communist Party.",Steve Tsang
"Time for Hong Kong to officially recognise gay marriages, for the greater good of society. It is not just about rights and benefits, but also about legal limits and obligations. For example, financial disclosure laws and conflict of interest legislation cover only opposite-sex spouses but not gay partners, and this is not in the public interest.",Will Yip

"How to defuse the extradition crisis: start by fixing Hong Kong’s social ills and end with democracy. By trying to wait out the storm, Chief Executive Carrie Lam is making another error of judgment. An inquiry into the police’s response to protesters would ease tensions but, in the long run, Hong Kong’s government must be legitimised by a democratic election.",Albert Cheng
"Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency may spell bad news for Hong Kong and mainland payment services – if regulators don’t step in first.

Global regulators, however, are already expressing concern.",Ryan King
"Can Beijing let Hong Kong be Hong Kong and allow the city the room it needs to breathe?.

"If Hong Kong’s extradition bill protesters want to defend the rule of law, they must also be prepared to face it. Attacking officers and refusing to let those inside the police headquarters leave are criminal acts, while besieging government offices to force the chief executive to interfere in prosecution decisions could be seen as an attempt to pervert justice.",Grenville Cross

The chief executive, who once said she would step down if she lost the people’s trust, should honour her pledge. The mass protests against the government’s legal proposal make that clear.",Albert Cheng
"When Hong Kong police hurt our children, rather than protect them, they shatter our trust in good governance. The clash at Admiralty is bringing back the terrors of Tiananmen, as Hong Kong parents beg for their children’s safety.

"Four reasons quantitative easing is not the solution to the global economy’s problems right now. The damaging effects of the previous rounds of quantitative easing are still being felt in low bond yields, falls in European and American bank shares and increased income inequality.

More worryingly for the city, perhaps, lawyers, bankers and businesspeople report it is increasingly tough to do international business here.",Richard Harris
"Why Hong Kong’s extradition bill is not just another law to Beijing and Carrie Lam. Both the Chinese and Hong Kong governments seem to be taking the view that the unrest over the extradition bill has been stirred up by external forces. Backtracking on the bill would now be seen as capitulation to the West, not just Hong Kong youth.",Michael Chugani
"Why Donald Trump’s tariffs should not be the concern of the World Trade Organisation.

"As North Korea doubles down on its nuclear weapons, Trump and the US are stuck with ‘strategic patience’. From the ‘fire and fury’ days of Donald Trump’s opening year as president, the US seems to have come full circle to the Obama era’s approach on North Korea.

Could a similar court, with its own panel of reputable advisers and lay jurors from outside the mainland, be set up to handle rendition cases from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan?",Anthony Neoh
"The trade war shows China’s economic dream is dying. Beijing now has a choice: open up or stagnate. The US is demanding that China change course and, for all its growth and promises, Beijing is in no position to argue: in tech, it still lags at least 10 years behind the US and doesn’t have the depth of skills to produce its own high-end goods.",Graeme Maxton
"US criticism of China rings hollow when America itself has betrayed its own ideals.

"Trump is foolish to use US stock market as a weapon in the trade war with China while a real crisis looms.

"China and Russia aren’t economic equals but, thanks to the US trade war, their partnership looks built to last. Until now, Russia’s relationship with China has looked decidedly one-sided, but Donald Trump’s trade war has changed all that, and Moscow could be a natural hedge against international pressure.",Dmitriy Frolovskiy

What Kaohsiung mayor Han Kuo-yu’s perfectly timed trip to Hong Kong reveals about Beijing. Kaohsiung’s Han Kuo-yu pulled off an impressive political tightrope walk during his trip to Hong Kong and the mainland. But the success of his visit and a remark made by Hong Kong lawmaker Abraham Razack also speak volumes about Beijing’s tolerance.,Alice Wu
"Hong Kong’s elderly will have to make their peace with working till they drop. By raising the age cut-off for welfare payments to the elderly, the government was trying to address the reality of our ageing society. However, a more comprehensive approach that recognises the skills the elderly have to offer would be preferable.",Mike Rowse
"War on climate change is doomed if China turns back towards the coalface.

"How Hong Kong’s extradition bill falls short of the deal we need with mainland China. Talks began more than 20 years ago between Hong Kong and Beijing on a rendition agreement.

The world has changed since Hong Kong was first named the world’s freest economy and it’s time for the government to intervene more to stop the rot.",Regina Ip
"Mainland migrants are needed in Hong Kong. The city should not scrap the one-way permit scheme, but improve it. The criticism directed at the mainland migrants in our midst is based on half-truths and prejudice, and should not be the basis of our policy. The scheme should stay, both for humanistic and practical reasons, but we should address genuine concerns.",Paul Yip
"The next financial crisis will be worse than the 2008 crash. Here’s how the world can prepare for it.

"Hong Kong’s extradition bill should strike fear in all who do business in China, exemptions notwithstanding.

"China is seeking a stable solution to its economic slowdown, not the quick fix of a stimulus package. Beijing won’t revisit its past policy of pumping money into the economy at the expense of long-term sustainability.

Neither side is likely to want a return to the old status quo.",Neal Kimberley
"Why the Made in China 2025 road map to hi-tech supremacy will miss its deadline.
